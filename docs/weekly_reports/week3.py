# Week #3 report

### What have you done this week?
- Implement and optimize my Miller-Rabin primality test algorithm
- Completed, but not merged, because finishing writing tests is WIP:
    - Generating the RSA keys
    - Encoding in asn.1 format, and storing keys in files

### What has been unclear or problematic? 
- I'm fine to use existing [asn1 encoding library](https://pypi.org/project/pyasn1/), intead of implementing that myself, right? 

### What next?
- Public key encryption (Confidentality) with private key decryption
- Private key encryption (Authenticity) with public key decryption
- Using both encryptions to get the best of both worlds
