# Week #4 report

### What have you done this week?
- Public key encryption (Confidentality) with private key decryption (not merged yet)
- Private key encryption (Authenticity) with public key decryption (not merged yet)
- Optimizing the is_prime() function; check for divisibilty by small prime numbers (numbers under 4000)
- Generate the smallest prime numbers up to n, using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm

### What has been unclear or problematic? 
- We'll have 5 minutes for the presentation, right? I'm not sure how would I fit all this information into 5 minutes. What part should I focus on, when presenting? I usually like when presenters give a background about why the technology is used instead of others, and what problems it solves, but that alone would take up a lot of the 5 minutes. 

### What next?
- Finish the message encoding with the two-part encryption.
- Write the tests for this.
- Peer reviews.
