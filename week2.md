# Week #2 report

### What have you done this week?
- Researched RFA algorithm
- Start doing it manually (with smaller numbers of course) on paper to make sure the fundamentals are correct and deeply rooted
- Prepare the development environment
- Started working on the Miller-Rabin prime test
- Set up coverage, planned how testing might be for this project

### How has the project progressed?
 - Got a deeper understanding how my choosen algorithm it works
- The development environment is set up and ready to progress with development
- Got a deep understanding how the algorithm works

### What has been unclear or problematic? 
- I'm not really sure if project needs a UI or not.
    - Is printing in the terminal enough for this problem? (RSA)


### What next?
- Finish the Miller-Rabin prime test
    - Write tests to make sure the prime test works.
- Start work on the RSA algorithm itself.
