# Week #1 report

### What have you done this week?
- Registration to Moodle
- Checked out the scope of the course
- Checked out all the recommended project ideas, and decided on one of them
- Completed the Specification document and the Week #1 report
- Acquire an understanding about the requirements of the course
### How has the project progressed?
- Acquired some understanding about all the recommended project ideas, and choose the one I'm most interested in.
- Set up the development environment.
- Outlined a schedule on how to progress in the following weeks.

### What has been unclear or problematic? 
- So far nothing, I'm curious about the feedback on the Specification document and the scope of the project

### What next?
- Wait for the feedback on the Specification document, and move forward according to that. If nothing needs to be changed, get a deeper understanding about the algorithm. Replicate it in practice first, then replicate it in code.
